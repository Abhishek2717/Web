                <p>A little food has never hurt anyone nor our Cloud Kitchen, which is a 
                React application. It helps the different restaurants and food outlets to 
                maximize their business as it provides food-delivery, customization of the 
                dish and adding requests or notes. It is more of your one-stop for all 
                food-items, hence increasing the efficiency of work and it is made keeping 
                in mind the customerâ€™s needs.</p>

                <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                <p>There is no project without a little challenge. Our service is to the client 
                and hence client satisfaction is a priority. Initially the client needed a slider 
                cart which we had to fit in. Every team faced their own set of challenges and so 
                did our designing team! Designing the application was a bit of a bummer.</p>

                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                <p>Thanks to our team of champion UI/UX designers, we pulled off a good-looking 
                website, rather a beautiful one! We had to go through a few iterations before coming 
                up with the design we currently have. The team worked well both for the design and the 
                frontend work.</p></Fade>
