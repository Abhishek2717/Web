                    <p>Kartikey and Saloni, our co-founders, gave their idea a boost in 2018. 
                    Kartikey started this journey by himself ,but subsequently connected with 
                    like-minded individuals with whom he could collaborate. Starting as Koders 
                    was not pre-planned.</p>
                    <p>The interest of developing and creating apps for fun drove towards a path 
                    of exploring new opportunities. From working on minor projects in college 
                    to majors, from one in number to many. The cycle began by thinking OUT OF THE BOX!
